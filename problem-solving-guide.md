### General Problem Solving Techniques

1. Always have a plan
2. Restate the problem: check problem from every angle
3. Dividing the problem
4. Start with what you already know: try to start with what you know and work outward from there
5. Reduce the problem: reduce the scope of problem by either adding or removing constraints to produce the problem that you do know how to solve. Reducing allows us to pin point exactly where the remaining difficulty lies
6. Look for analogies: find similarity between current problem and a similar problem already solved
7. Experiment: Try things and observe the results in a controlled manner
8. Don't get frustrated



### Points

- There is no one “right” solution for a problem, as any program that meets all constraints counts as a  solution, and for any solution, there is no one “right” way of reaching it
- The primary goal is, of course, to find a program that solves the stated problem and meet all constraints.
- The secondary goal is to find that program in the minimal amount of time. 
- Minimizing the number of steps isn't a goal, and no one has to know how many steps you took.
